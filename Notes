It's essential you have visibility of the performance of your DB and queries.

Laravel Debug Bar
-----------------
- composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev

- Check page load time towards the right of the debug bar. You should aim for less then 1000ms.
- Look at the number of queries. Can it be reduced by n+1 etc?
- Do you need indexing on any queries using orderBy?
- Look at the Models tabs to see how many models are being loaded. An unexpectedly high number might
give you an idea of why it is slow.
- The Memory Usage tab can give you a rough insite into what is going on. Laravel uses roughly 4mb of
memory by itself. Anything significantly over this should be a warning sign.






Checklist
----------
- Are you using the $with attribute anywhere?
- Do you need indexing?
- Are you selecting only the columns you need?
