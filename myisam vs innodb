MyISAM
-------
- Holds data in memory
- MyISAM is faster when you insert, update, or delete large amounts of data, as the database doesnâ€™t have to use disk space
- Doesn't support transactions
- Performance with large volumes of data leaves a lot to be desired in comparison with InnoDB.
- No foreign key constraints
- In MyISAM, there is a key buffer that is used for indexes

InnoDB
------
- Uses disk space for storage
- InnoDB is more efficient at indexing and retrieving information, and is generally a far more advanced and preferred option
- InnoDB is a transactional storage engine and can do transactions with rollbacks if the transaction doesn't complete
- InnoDB offers full ACID compliance (Atomic, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) whereas MyIsam does not
- The performance of InnoDB with large volumes of data is better than that of MyISAM
- InnoDB offers flexible row-level locks while MyISAM can only do table-level locks. The crash recovery in InnoDB is also superior
- In InnoDB, there is a large buffer pool that can be used to store both data and indexes

When it is better to use MyISAM and when you should use InnoDB
----------------------------------------------------------------
If a MyISAM table has an issue, it will only affect the table. If there are any problems with other tables or databases, they will not affect
the operations of other tables or databases. Therefore, MyISAM can be recommended for servers with multiple sites.

The InnoDB storage engine is recommended for frequent operations with tables. It has better performance, better functionality,
and can also substantially reduce memory usage on the server. Naturally, it is generally preferred over MyISAM. Still, it is worth noting that,
because issues with InnoDB tables can cause data loss in other InnoDB tables, it is important to make sure you have enabled automatic backups.
